# Importing an external plugin repo with history preserved

Procedure used to pull `grafana/clock-panel` into this monorepo at
`packages/@plugins/grafana-clock-panel/`, preserving full upstream git history.

Method: `git filter-repo` (rewrite history into subdir, then merge with
`--allow-unrelated-histories`) rather than `git subtree add`. Chosen because it
produces clean per-commit path rewriting without subtree's merge-commit noise,
and doesn't couple us to `git subtree` for future maintenance.

## Prerequisites

```bash
brew install git-filter-repo
```

**Confirm the actual git repo root before picking the subdirectory prefix —
do not assume it equals your current working directory:**

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```

This repo's cwd during dev is often `.../dataViz/plugins`, but the git repo
root is `.../dataViz` one level up. The `--to-subdirectory-filter` path must
be relative to the true repo root (e.g. `plugins/packages/@plugins/<name>`),
not relative to cwd. Getting this wrong silently lands the imported package
one directory too shallow (e.g. `./packages/@plugins/<name>` at the repo
root instead of `./plugins/packages/@plugins/<name>`) — caught by comparing
against an existing sibling package's real path, not by any error.

## Steps

1. Clone the source repo into a scratch location (outside this repo):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/grafana/clock-panel /tmp/clock-panel
   ```

2. Rewrite all history in the clone so every path lives under the target
   subdirectory:
   ```bash
   cd /tmp/clock-panel
   git filter-repo --to-subdirectory-filter packages/@plugins/grafana-clock-panel
   ```

3. Back in this repo, add the rewritten clone as a temporary remote and fetch:
   ```bash
   git remote add clock-panel-src /tmp/clock-panel
   git fetch clock-panel-src
   ```

4. Merge histories without committing yet, so the result can be inspected:
   ```bash
   git merge --allow-unrelated-histories clock-panel-src/main --no-commit
   ```

5. Inspect staged result (`git status`, `git diff --cached`), resolve any
   conflicts, adjust the imported package to fit this repo's conventions
   (package.json name, tsconfig references, webpack config, wiring into root
   tsconfig / vitest aliases / docker-compose — see `CLAUDE.md` "Adding a new
   plugin package").

   Work through "What comes along with an import" below — a standalone repo
   carries far more of its own identity than just source code, and almost
   none of it fails loudly when it stops working.

6. Once satisfied, commit the merge and remove the temporary remote:

   ```bash
   git commit
   git remote remove clock-panel-src
   ```

## What comes along with an import

A standalone repo bakes its own identity into a surprising number of files.
**Almost none of these fail loudly** when they stop working after an import —
they go silently inert, which is worse than an error. Survey all of them
during step 5 rather than discovering them one CI failure at a time.

### Dead weight — only the repo root's copy is ever read

| File | Why it's dead |
|---|---|
| `package-lock.json` / `yarn.lock` | pnpm workspaces use exactly one lockfile, at the workspace root. Delete. |
| `.npmrc` | Merged from the workspace root anyway; a nested copy repeating the same settings is redundant. |
| `renovate.json`, `.github/renovate.json` | Renovate reads exactly one config per repo (root). Nested configs are never discovered or merged. |
| `.github/workflows/*.yml` | GitHub Actions only discovers workflows at the **repo root**. Nested workflow files never trigger — and `paths:` filters can't change that, they only scope an already-discovered root workflow. |

For renovate specifically: if the imported config differs meaningfully
(different grouping, cooldowns, path exclusions), fold the relevant parts into
the root config as scoped `packageRules`
(`matchFileNames: ["plugins/packages/@plugins/<name>/**"]`) rather than
keeping the nested file.

To *revive* a nested workflow, copy it to the repo root, add a `paths:` filter
scoping it to the package, and swap `npm ci` for pnpm
(`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` + `pnpm --filter <pkg> run <script>`). Keep
the real logic in the package's own `package.json` script so only thin
plumbing lives at root — that also minimizes what has to be rebuilt if the
package is ever ejected back out.

### Silently inert — needs porting to a monorepo-native form

- **`packageManager` field** — only the workspace root's value governs corepack.
  A nested one is inert and misleading. Remove it.
- **`overrides` (npm) / `resolutions` (yarn)** — pnpm reads *neither*, and does
  not support per-package overrides at all. Check whether the pin is still
  load-bearing (`git log -S '"overrides"'` to find why it was added), then port
  it to the workspace root's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` using a **parent-scoped
  selector** so its effect stays scoped to the package:
  ```yaml
  overrides:
    <pkg-name>>somedep: 1.2.3
  ```
  Note pnpm 11+ no longer reads the top-level `pnpm` field in `package.json` —
  workspace settings (`overrides`, `allowBuilds`, …) live in
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- **`engines.node` / `.nvmrc`** — an imported package can force a workspace-wide
  Node bump. Reconcile the root `.nvmrc` and any `Dockerfile` base images.

### Silently skipped — script name and semantics mismatches

Turborepo matches tasks to `package.json` scripts **by exact name**. A package
whose script is named differently simply gets skipped, with no warning and a
green build:

- `typecheck` vs this repo's `type-check` → the package is never type-checked.
- Verify semantics too, not just names: an imported `format` script may be
  `prettier --write` (mutates) where this repo's convention is a **check**,
  with mutation living in `format:fix`. A mutating script in CI silently
  rewrites files instead of failing on drift.

Cross-check every task name in `turbo.json` against each imported script.

### Repo-identity-bound — cannot be mechanically ported

These are tied to the *source repo's* identity, not the plugin's code, and
need real infrastructure decisions (and usually someone with Vault/admin
access). Leave them dead until there's an explicit cutover plan:

- **Vault secret paths** — namespaced per repo
  (`ci/repo/<org>/<repo>/<secret>`). Auth is OIDC, so the subject includes the
  repo; copying the path is not enough, the new repo's identity must be
  authorized. See `grafana-engineering:vault-add-secret`.
- **External service project IDs** — Crowdin project ids, GitHub project board
  ids, etc. Enabling these in the new repo while the old one is still live
  gives the external service **two writers**, which silently diverges both
  copies.
- **GitHub App installations** (e.g. `grafana-pr-automation`) and
  **self-hosted runner labels** (e.g. `runs-on: ubuntu-x64`) — must exist for
  the new repo.

### Branch protection: signed commits

If the target repo requires verified signatures, the imported history will be
unsigned and `git push` is rejected outright. See
`resign-imported-history.md` — plain `git rebase` does **not** work for this.

## Optional: preserving other upstream branches

`git fetch clock-panel-src` also pulls in every other branch from the source
repo (rewritten to the same subdirectory prefix) as remote-tracking refs
(`refs/remotes/clock-panel-src/*`) — not just `main`. Only `main` gets merged
in step 4. Removing the temp remote in step 6 deletes all those tracking
refs; any commits only reachable from them become unreachable and eventually
garbage-collected. They remain on the original upstream repo regardless —
this only affects what's kept locally/in this repo.

**Before removing the temp remote, prompt the user whether they want these
other branches preserved as local branches.** If yes:

```bash
for b in $(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/remotes/clock-panel-src | grep -v HEAD); do
  name=${b#clock-panel-src/}
  git branch "clock-panel/$name" "$b"
done
```

(Prefixed `clock-panel/` to avoid collisions with existing branch names.)
Do this only on explicit confirmation — default is to let them be deleted
with the temp remote.
